# webgourmet

This is a read-only, pseudo-web interface for [Gourmet Recipe Manager](https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet).

The original idea was to generate a simple searchable web interface based on the HTML export provided by [Gourmet Recipe Manager](https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet) ([here](https://jeinkale.eu/ingrid.falk/rezepte/)'s an example of how I use it).

However here the HTML export is provided by perl scripts based on the original [Gourmet Recipe Manager](https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet) database. This database is by default called `recipes.db` and usually can be found in the `.gourmet` directory.

The scripts are based on [this approach](https://github.com/jesjimher/webgourmet), hence the same name.
